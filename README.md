Project to create a Food-Order App (from the "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in Udemy).

**About the project:** This project corresponds to section 18 of the mentioned course and was performed completely autonoumously by me with the exception of two features:
- The "index.css" file which came given as it was not the objective of the project to focus on the styling. Even so, I have added some styling to build an Error Modal and some little extra functionalities like the bin icon which is used to delete the cart items.
- The backend of the project which also came given, as the course is focused on frontend development.

The goal of the project was top create a web which allows the user to select among a handful of food options which are retrieved from the backend server. After that, the user can go to a "Cart" modal and modify the quantity of items or commit the order by filling up a form with its personal details. The user's order is then saved into the backend.

**Result:**

**Built with:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

**Accomplishments:**
- Consolidated the knowledge regarding frontend-backend communication and how to create different kinds of HTTP requests.
- Learned how to handle possible HTTP request errors, avoiding a crash of the web and informing the user about it in an elegant manner.
- Learned that Input elements are a common case for building a custom reusable component, avoiding repetition of information.
- Used the special React Profiler tab from the inspector tools in order to check the components execution pattern and find components which can have a performance optimization.
- Used "memo" to optimize the performance of children components that were being executed unnecessarily whenever the parent component was executed.
